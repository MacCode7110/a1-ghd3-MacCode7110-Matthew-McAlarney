Design Achievements:

Achievement 1 (Estimated 4 Points): 
Used Bulma CSS framework to style the webpage and essentially set the backdrop for the animation; to make the webpage appear aesthetically pleasing, I used the Bulma CSS framework to style the h1 title, footer, and section that contains the D3 graphics primitives. I applied Bulma CSS styling using color, text fonts, text sizes, text weight, and text positioning. And, in order to apply Bulma CSS styling, I added numerous HTML elements to create a proper webpage structure to hold the visualization.

Achievement 2 (Estimated 4 Points):
Applied the D3 mouseover and mouseout events on all shapes to make each one interactive on an aesthetic level. When the user hovers over any of the shapes with their mouse, the color of the shape becomes black to signify that it has been selected. When the user moves their mouse outside of the area of a given shape, the color of that shape returns to its default fill or stroke color.

Achievement 3 (Estimated 4 Points):
Applied the D3 mouseover and mouseout events on all shapes to make each one interactive on an informational level as well. When the user hovers over any of the shapes with their mouse, type of shape that has been selected will appear in the top right next to the "Selected Shape" text. When the user moves their mouse outside of the area of a given shape, the "Selected Shape" text will show "None".
